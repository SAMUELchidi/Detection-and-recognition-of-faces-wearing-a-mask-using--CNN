
 Requirements 

  Python 3.7.3
  Tensorflow  2.8.0 (if its not compatible, you have to downgrade it to the earlier versions)
  Numpy    1.21.5
  Open cv 
  imutils   0.5.4
  keras.	2.8.0
  face_recognition 
  
  
  
Can be installed via the command prompt "pip install .."

Alternatively, you can use the Anaconda version 3  to install the libraries and their dependencies. 
Again the Anaconda navigator might need to be downgraded to version 1.9.7 inorder to execute the python scripts.

If at all you encounter any problem with open cv, kindly specify the version and start by installing its 'contrib', but it must work;
            opencv-contrib-python              4.5.5.64
            opencv-python-headless             4.2.0.34
